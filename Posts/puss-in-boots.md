Puss in Boots: The Last Wish — Finding Contentment Beyond the Fear of Death
===========================================================================

As you can tell from the title, this article is about the movie Puss in Boots: The Last Wish. However, this isn’t so much a movie review, as it is an exploration of the movie’s main themes and its’ handling of those themes to craft a message. How the movie goes about accomplishing this is particularly standout in my opinion because for a movie that many would consider a children’s film, it handles ideas of death, discontent, and the absurdness with which we go about trying to gain satisfaction, with the same sage-wisdom and spirit of something like Ecclesiastes or a letter penned by classical stoics. All while still having funny spanish cat man jokes and tons of nursery rhyme puns. It’s a good time. And I really appreciated a message like this in the fog of our current cultural moment that often says we must do more, get more, and be more. So please allow me to over analyze the funny cat movie. Before we jump in though, you may be asking “Why is he writing this article almost two years after the movie came out? Is it because the message was **so** deep that it took over him two years to digest it???” No. It’s because I just watched the movie for the first time last weekend, it’s on Netflix now. Leave me alone. Also watch the movie before you read, I spoil most of it here.

Discontent
==========

The plot of the movie is pretty simple. There’s a star in a forest that will grant any one wish for the person who can find it. Through circumstance, there are three main parties that are trying to find the star and get their wish granted (I’m leaving out Kitty Softpaws sorry) — Puss in Boots (who from here on I will be referring to as ‘Puss’ for sake of brevity), who is on the last of his nine cat lives and wants to wish for his lives back; Goldilocks— who wants to wish for a new human family (the three bears have adopted her but she’s not satisfied and wants a specifically human family); and Jack Horner — who wants all of the magic in the world to himself because he was outshined as a child by someone who had magic. These three parties are interesting because each of them are experiencing discontent with their current circumstances, but none of them are discontent in the same way. Puss has recognized the goodness (or perceived goodness) of his life as a legend and is wasting his last life ruled by fear of losing what he has. Goldilocks hasn’t recognized the goodness of her life and that what she’s been looking for has been in front of her all along. Jack Horner is envious of the good that others have (in this case magic) and refuses to recognize and enjoy all the good that is in his possession (tons of wealth, a loving family, loyal employees, etc). We’ll save the resolution to Puss’s dilemma for later since that also ties into his newfound fear of death. But the resolution to both Goldilocks’ and Harlow’s plotlines make a profound point on their own.

Goldilocks spends most of her journey onscreen being flippant and unkind to the three bears. She attempts to keep up the facade that she likes being apart of the family, but is all the while using them to get her wish granted. Her journey to the wish resolves when her adopted family is in danger and she’s about to lose what she had taken for granted. Only after reflection throughout the journey and almost losing what she had in front of her, does she realize that what she’s wanted has been her’s this entire time, she just needed to embrace them for what they were.

Jack Horner on the other hand has a different resolution because the nature of his discontent is of a more destructive kind. Horner can not be happy as long as there are others who have and are enjoying what he wants. His wish is not to be magical, his wish is to have **all** the magic in the world to himself. His discontent lies not only with his perceived lack, but also that others would dare to enjoy the goodness and status that only he deserves. This kind of discontent is so corrosive because it’s not only self-loathing, but also thrives on envying others. Jack Horner’s resolution in the movie is that he’s taken down by the other parties and is destroyed along with the wishing star. This is, unfortunately, the only kind of resolution that can come from this kind of discontent, unless a serious change is made in the heart of the one who harbors it. Discontent of this variety is harmful to the self, to the community, and can never be satisfied because there is no reality where you’re always ahead of everyone else. Let us also not confuse this kind of discontent with a desire to be the best. Someone who desires to be the best at basketball might work hard, learn from teammates, watch the game, and take whatever measures they need to in order to improve and be the best. However, someone with the same kind of discontent as Horner would only be satisfied when he’s the only one allowed to play televised basketball and if people packed out stadiums to see him run around dunking from end to end for two hours, alone.

Death
=====

As we said before, Puss experiences discontent just like Goldilocks and Horner, but because he’s the main character, we get to spend time fleshing out the other elements of his struggle. Specifically, we explore his newfound anxiety and fear towards death. As a cat with nine lives, Puss has never had to face or think about real death. He has lived a prodigal and care-free life of adventuring, partying, and doing what he wants. On his last life, brought down to reality by the felt closeness of death, he experiences anxiety, fear, and panic attacks. His first solution, by the messaging of the movie, is the wrong one. He hides out in the house of an elderly cat lady where he buries his adventuring gear in a grave and resigns himself to a life of gorging food and napping. However, this isn’t much of a long term solution as trouble, as it does for us all, eventually finds him.

What we learn from Puss running and from him pursuing his wish is that Puss is afraid to die (shocking). But it’s this crippling fear of death that is, ironically, keeping him from living. And this fear of death is only so crippling for him because more than anything, he loves himself. He is not content with the idea that his adventuring days are coming to an end. The thought that there’s a day when he won’t be around to hear the praise of the people or feel the rhythm of the party scares him. In the Cave of Lost Souls, he reconvenes with caricatures of his past lives and reflects on what he believed it meant to live. To him, living meant being praised, having accomplishments, being remembered, having fun. And he died several times over pursuing these things. But when it comes time for him to die for good, the treasures he pursued give him no comfort. He’s not satisfied, and he’s afraid to die because he has not ever truly lived.

Truly living
============

The model example for all these struggling characters of what it means to truly live is the dog. The weird dog. The dog has not been on any cool adventures, he has no loving family, he is not even very much liked by the characters he comes in contact with. Yet somehow, he’s always there for others and smiling. We find out everything we need to know about him when he tells his life story to Kitty and Puss. He was abandoned by his family. He kept coming back and they kept throwing him out, until one day, they stuffed him in a sock and threw him in a river, probably hoping that he would drown to death. This is his takeaway from those events as he reflects on what happened to him:

> So, I got a great story and a free sweater out of it _(he says still wearing the sock)_. Win-win.

Puss says what literally everyone watching is thinking at this moment:

> Dude, you didn’t win. You of all people should have a wish.

To which, the dog replies:

> I already have a comfy sweater and two best friends. I got everything I could wish for.

What is the difference between this dog and everyone else? **Perspective**. He actively chooses to chase the good in the circumstances he finds himself in and is content with what he finds. Even when others reject him or he’s in danger, he keeps chasing the good that he can see beyond fear of failure or losing what he has. He can be so kind and friendly to everyone because he is not there to compete with them, he shows up to the party already full and satisfied with what life has afforded him. He has fully understood what this means:

> “Choose not to be harmed — and you won’t feel harmed. Don’t feel harmed — and you haven’t been.” — Marcus Aurelius

On the other side of Puss’ duel with death (literally), Puss’ near death experiences and insight from the dog forge for him a fresh perspective. He will never have the comfort and security that his past situation afforded him. Those lives are gone, he wasted them. But in another sense, were they really wasted? It took him discarding those lives and being forced to deal with the reality of death and true loss, to see what should have been plain to him all along. He now cherishes the relationships and adventures he has in a way he never had before. Every moment is more meaningful now because he neither neglects the reality of death nor fears it. He is freed from an unhealthy love of self and a crippling fear of death to the open yet-finite horizon of truly living.
