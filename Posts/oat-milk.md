Oat milk has forever changed the lactose-free game
==================================================

About two years ago, my aunt (a professional foodie like myself) brought to my attention that she had recently found the best creamer she had ever tasted and recommended that I give it a try. I take drink drinking **very** seriously, always evaluating the best that mankind has to offer and so I eagerly asked her to send me a picture of the creamer in question. And then I saw it. _Oatmilk creamer_? You have to understand that a non-trivial part of my identity since birth has been that of a mammal milk drinker. I came out the womb drinking milk and to the dust I shall return so. Or at least, so I thought. I value my aunt’s opinion highly and so I tried the creamer. And it was good. It was **really** good. This prompted a gradual shift in my preferred creamer at home and at coffee shops from whole milk to oat milk. But I recently discovered something that prompted me to write this post. Oat milk isn’t just a good creamer, oat milk is just _good._ Drinking, mixing, cooking (not sure about baking though), oat milk is just good as a stand-in for milk (unlike some of the **other** so called milk substitutes). So let’s talk about why I believe this is the case. I should prepare you beforehand, if what you are looking for is an analytical break down on the benefits of oat milk, you will **not** find that here. There will be no numbers and no charts. There will be no facts or logic. But there will be truth. How will you know you ask? Your heart will burn within you as you read and you will know, deep down, that I speak the truth. So let’s get started.

Oats are simply built different
===============================

Ever since the Quakers invented oats in the mid 1600s (though whether the invention was out of physical necessity or religious fervor I do not know), they have presented themselves as a humble and versatile resource. From cereal, to bread, to lotion, to soap, and even as a [environmental cleaning agent](https://phys.org/news/2015-02-oats-heavy-metals-contaminated-soil.html) (yes oats can literally heal the earth), oats have been there for us. Sure dairy milk itself has many uses, but as we have considered the source of oat milk, let us consider dairy milk’s source: cows. Have you ever seen a cow in person? They are not very impressive. In fact they spend most of their days doing nothing. And yet it is said that they can consume, on average, 91 tons of feed in their lifetime. Laid out, that’s probably several miles worth of grass and grains being fed to these free loaders. These heifers are literally eating our planet up. Why not just cut the middle man, and milk the oats instead.

Oat milk has the moral high ground
==================================

Now, I want you to empathize with these cows for a second here. I know this is hard because I just called them planet consuming free loaders, but I really need you to try for this section to work. These poor saps didn’t ask to be born in the conditions they often find themselves in. Worn down, fattened, and sent to an early end by the cravings and desires of a species plagued with insatiable greed and appetite. This is no life for a creature. Consider on the other hand, the condition of the gracious oat. Lacking both sentience and willpower, the oat still somehow finds it in it’s heart to provide for those who humbly ask. The chief aim of the oat, it’s _telos_ if you will, is to sacrifice it’s existence for the nourishment or sustaining of another. By allowing itself to be used, the oat lifts man and animal kind to greater heights. You don’t believe me? Listen then to the words of Jesus the Christ who is literally God:

> Truly, truly, I say to you, unless a grain of wheat falls into the earth and dies, it remains alone; but if it dies, it bears much fruit. — John 12:24

God (who I think would know since He helped the Quakers create the oats) recognizes the virtuous purposes of the oat and it is becoming of us to graciously accept the generosity of the oat by using it to further humankind (especially in the area of great tasting coffee/tea).

Oat milk just taste better
==========================

POV: You are the barista at my local coffee shop handing me a drink

Though I’ve saved this for the end, this section is really the crux of my argument because if oat milk does not taste good, why are we even talking about it? Coffee is extremely useful. So useful and good in fact, that when it spread to Europe, [clergymen lobbied for it to be banned on grounds of it being satanic or some form of witchcraft.](https://www.ncausa.org/About-Coffee/History-of-Coffee) Coffeehouses only began to spring up after Pope Clement VIII tasted coffee and gave it his blessing on the basis that it was pretty tasty. We don’t have record of what his drink of choice was, but I chose to believe that it was a latte, since coffee alone is pretty gross. In fact, [latte’s and coffee with milk are dated to have come about around the same time that coffee was becoming popular in Europe](https://perfectdailygrind.com/2022/06/what-is-a-latte/) (the 17th century), which makes sense because again, coffee alone is gross. And so the job of any milk or milk substitute in coffee has always been to make it not gross. But what is it that makes oat milk so special? For me, oat milk has this heft to it that adds some weight and creaminess to the drink. This is hard to explain if you haven’t had a latte, cappuccino, or something similar, but ideally, you want your drink to taste like a liquid pillow. You don’t want it to be weighty like a smoothie or anything, but it also shouldn’t hit you as a flat liquid like water. Oatmilk also has this slightly nutty flavor to it that complements teas and coffee well without taking anything away from the flavor of the drink. It’s always hard describing experiences like music or food with words, so I promise it’s better than I’m describing.

In Conclusion
=============

Go buy a chai latte or a cappuccino with oat milk. You will thank me. If you try it and don’t like it, let me know and I’ll take you to a real coffee shop and order for you because you probably did it wrong. Thanks for reading.
