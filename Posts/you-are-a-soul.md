You are a soul: a biblical perspective on what makes a being
============================================================

What are you? Or rather, what are **we**? As long as humans have been doing the human thing people have continued to think about this question and related ones, offering their own answers and ideas in turn. Words that tend to come up in these kinds of conversations are: beings, souls, spirit, physical, material and immaterial, selves, etc.. While these words and similar ones seem to be used by everyone, I’ve found that the way they’re used tends to depend on the speaker, especially terms like “soul” or “spirit”. Sometimes the speaker uses them as if they are interchangeable, sometimes they are used as if they are related but separate, and sometimes they’re used as if one exist and the other doesn’t. What influences how we use these words? No doubt, a large part of how we view ourselves can be credited to our upbringing and cultural contexts. In western society, our paradigms about the human soul are a hodgepodge of many different philosophies and collections of ideas. As a follower of Christ and someone who deeply enjoys the Hebrew bible and the Greek new testament, I thought it would be interesting to explore the biblical view of the human soul to see how it may or may not differ from our own western view. This post may get a little nerdy, but if you can bear with me, I think you may find some interesting ideas to think on, regardless of if you’re a Christian or not.

Our cultural backpacks
======================

Like I mentioned before, what you think about an idea is often greatly influenced by the culture you grew up in as well as the context of your specific home life. This means that while what everyone in a western context thinks when they hear the word “soul” may not be exactly the same, their ideas will likely be similar. And then what everyone in a similar part of the country, social group, ethnicity, religion, and so on think when they hear the same word may be even more similar. This goes for most words and ideas, not just this particular case. I like the imagery that John H. Walton uses of a “cultural backpack”. Every person has a backpack with the label “soul” for example and inside that backpack are different thoughts and ideas tied to how you view the concept of “soul”. You may find some differences in your backpack from another person who grew up in your culture, but, largely, what you find will be markedly similar. However, if you talked to someone from a different culture than yours, you’d likely find that they may have thoughts and ideas in their backpack that are very different from your own. With this in mind, the major aim of this article is to look at some of what’s in our “soul” labeled backpack and compare it with the “soul” labeled backpack of the biblical writers. So what’s in our backpack?

What is a soul to us?
=====================

We may not find the same things in everyone’s backpack, but in western culture, I think two different sets of ideas can cover what most of us imagine when we hear the word “soul”.

**The first is that your soul is your inner essence**. The idea here is that your body is like a home or shell for your soul. A conduit for the real you. In this case, the term “spirit” can be taken as a synonym for soul or as something separate that works in tandem with your soul. It’s usually then thought that all humans have souls, this inner essence, and that it’s one of the major distinctions between us and animals, who are thought to have no spirit or soul. This isn’t too unlike the concept of soul in ancient Greek thought (They used the words _psyche_ _a_nd _thumos_ both of which have their own connotations which won’t be discussed here). Like us, they had diverse ideas about the soul, but we are more interested in the pervasive similarities. In their minds, the soul was thought to be immortal and the body was a tomb for it to be released from upon death, which may or may not be thought to lead to reincarnation. The body then, is thought of as incidental, a temporary inconvenience as you chase the purification of your soul through deep truths or virtuous behavior.

**The second is that your soul is your mind, will, and emotions.** I’d say that this is another popular conception of the soul in western culture. The idea is that when you speak of the “soul”, you’re really speaking about a intersection of these three other concepts. This may mean your soul is what drives your mind, will, and emotions or that your soul is them in a very literal sense or that the term “soul” is just a poetic way of talking about these three realities as we experience them.

I think one or some mixture of these ideas flood into our minds when have conversations about the soul. They are the items in our backpack, passed onto us through cultural osmosis. You may not even recognize that you have these ideas until you meet someone with a backpack full of very different ideas. On that note, lets meet with the many authors who wrote the Bible and hear them out on their own terms to understand what they would have thought when they heard the word “soul”.

What is a soul to the biblical authors?
=======================================

This question is actually deeper and more complex than I have space or ability to fully dive into here. The Bible as we have it now is broken into two major parts: the Hebrew Bible (or Old Testament) which is written in ancient Hebrew(and some Aramaic) and the New Testament, a collection of writings and letters by early followers of Jesus, which is written in Greek. This means that when studying a word in the Bible, the best approach is not to look it up in a modern dictionary, but to see how the original word is used throughout the text. This is fairly intuitive, since the way we often learn new words (without looking them up in a dictionary) is by seeing how they are used in conversation or the sentence we are reading. In case you want to study the words for yourself, the words we are looking at here (transliterated) are _nephesh_ and _psuchē_ in the Old and New Testaments respectively. As I just mentioned, I don’t have the space here to do an exhaustive exploration of the idea of “soul” in the Bible, but I do want to look at a couple key examples that I will help us compare and contrast with our modern view of the soul and bring us to some interesting conclusions.

Genesis 1 & 2
-------------

If you’re familiar with the Bible, you may be surprised (or unsurprised) that our word _nephesh_ comes up on the very first page of the Bible! Let’s take a look at how the word is used in the creation stories of Genesis 1 and 2.

> And God said, “Let the waters swarm with swarms of living **nephesh** , and let birds fly above the earth across the expanse of the heavens.” So God created the great sea creatures and every living **nephesh** that moves, with which the waters swarm, according to their kinds, and every winged bird according to its kind…And God said, “Let the earth bring forth living **nephesh** according to their kinds — livestock and creeping things and beasts of the earth according to their kinds” And it was so…And to every beast of the earth and to every bird of the heavens and to everything that creeps on the earth, everything that has the **nephesh** of life, I have given every green plant for food. And it was so.” — Genesis 1:20–21,24,30
> 
> then the Lord God formed the man of dust from the ground and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life and the man became a living **nephesh** — Genesis 2:7

Already we see some pretty significant differences from the modern imagination of soul. Whatever “soul” is to this biblical author, it’s not what differentiates us from animals, since animals are described as having souls too. Even more different, animals aren’t described as having souls, but as **being** souls. The human that God creates later is also called a “living **_nephesh_**”. Let’s make some observations.

1.  All living creatures have a soul.

**_nephesh_** is used of every created creature category at least once in Genesis 1 & 2. It’s not used of every created thing (like trees or the sun and moon), but it at least seems to be used of every breathing creature. This contrast with the idea that what makes humans different than animals is that we have souls (the bible does draw a line between humans and animals, just not on the point of souls)

2\. Living creatures are souls

**_nephesh_** is not just explained as something that creatures have, but what they are (big word incoming) **_ontologically._** Meaning that it’s core to what they are as beings. In fact, some people believe this word is better translated as “being” or “entire being”. This idea is different than the one we explored before where the soul is your trapped “inner self” that’s just waiting to leave this mortal body like a spiritual butterfly. It’s also different from the idea that your soul is just your mind, will, and emotions. While it certainly includes those things, the biblical perception of soul is also much more than them.

These observations, I would assume, raise a lot of questions. If we are souls, how does that relate to the concepts of body and spirit? The material and immaterial. In Psalm 42, the psalmist/poet says this:

> As a deer pants for flowing streams,
> 
> so pants my **nephesh** for you, O God.
> 
> My **nephesh** thirsts for God,
> 
> for the living God.

This desire or longing, seems spiritual in nature. Are our souls spiritual or physical then? I am provably material and my body has physical needs. What do we make of the psalmist’s words stated above then? We are starting to see something very interesting about the biblical concept of soul and there’s one place that I believe captures our questions perfectly.

Ecclesiastes 6
--------------

Our word “_nephesh”_ is used four times in this chapter, but we’re only going to look at three of those uses.

> ³If a man fathers a hundred children and lives many years, so that the days of his years are many, but his **nephesh** is not satisfied with life’s good things, and he also has no burial, I say that a stillborn child is better off than he…⁷All the toil of man is for his mouth, yet his **nephesh** is not satisfied…⁹Better is the sight of the eyes than the wandering of the **nephesh**…this also is…a striving after wind.

Our point isn’t to get into everything said here (though Ecclesiastes is certainly a book worth reading), but to see how our word is being used here and connect it with what we’ve already learned. The last two occurrences of our word are usually translated as appetite or crave, which makes sense given the context of the word. Here, the word soul is being used as a metonymy(just learned this word while writing this hehe) or stand-in for a person’s desires or deepest longings. But take a look at the nature of these longings being described. The images here (and earlier in the chapter before I started the quotation) are of a person who has physical desires that can go unmet and that seems unfair to the author. But the author also notes that a person can have physical desires, strive to meet them, succeed, and yet still be unsatisfied in their being(_nephesh)_. The resulting picture is this. Humans are an inseparable mix of spiritual and physical desires. You have spiritual and physical needs because you **are** spiritual and physical in nature. To ignore one or the other is to ignore part of your being.

To put it simply, you are a soul

Jesus, the New Testament, and the new soulful creation
------------------------------------------------------

If you’ve read through parts of the New Testament, this idea may seem incompatible with what you find there. You’ve got places like Matthew 10:28 and Hebrews 4:12 that use the greek word for soul that I mentioned earlier, _psuchē,_ and a word like body or spirit in the same sentence. My point is not that the idea of soul maps directly onto spirit or body, but that it seems to be a way of referring to you holistically, which then of course would include your body and spirit. If you do a word study on _psuchē_ yourself, I think you’ll see that many of the usages reflect this. Let’s look at Hebrews 4:12 as an example.

> ¹²For the word of God is living and active, sharper than any two-edged sword, piercing to the division of **psuchē**  and of spirit, of joints and of marrow, and discerning the thoughts and intentions of the heart.

Notice the pairing of subjects here. Soul and spirit, joints and marrow, thoughts and intentions. Attention is being drawn by the author, not to what makes these different, but to how closely related they are, and the point being made is that the word of God can split even these that are so closely knit. That being said, the idea of your “soul” being absent or separated from your body at death is very present in the New Testament (2 Corinthians 5:1–10). What do we make of this then? I’d argue (very strongly) that this state of being is presented as a welcomed change, but not as the finish line. Let me make two points to flesh out that statement. The first is that it's a welcomed change, not primarily because we are separated from the material world (as the greeks would suggest), but because we are “at home with the Lord”. The second is that this state is not the finish line. The end of the story is not us as disembodied spirit people who float around an monotonous white space of clouds and sky like most media imagines. The New Testament envisions a renewed creation, both heavens and earth, where God’s space and ours collide. Of course, this calls for a change in our current bodies, which were made for this current creation, but it doesn’t call for a change to no bodies. Passages like 1 Corinthians 15:34–49 and Philippians 3:20–21 describe the new bodies as “spiritual bodies” like the one Jesus had when He was resurrected. But again, this shouldn’t make us believe that this new body will have no physical nature, as Jesus could be touched and ate physical food, even after He rose from the dead. While we can only imagine, it’s likely that this new creation will be intensely physical and spiritual in ways that we can’t even imagine. We as souls or “beings”, are likely to be the same.

Filling our backpacks for the journey
=====================================

So what do we do with what we’ve talked about here? Is this all just information to know? Something for you to chew on and think through as an intellectual exercise? I certainly don’t think so. So then what do we do with these ideas? I’d say consider adding them to your backpack. We talked earlier about the idea of everyone having different backpacks that they are constantly pulling ideas from. It’s out of these ideas that you think and reason and live your daily life. If you follow Jesus, your goal is align your behaviors with His. This means that you also must be thinking from a similar worldview and set of ideas that He did because that’s what informed His behavior. However, even if you don’t follow Jesus, I’d still say that you can consider some of these ideas and how they align or don’t align with what you already think about our existence as beings. There’s more I could have said about this subject and I’m sure much more that I didn’t know to say, but I hope that this was at least a compelling touch on the subject of the soul that drives you to do your own personal study.
